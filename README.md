 # By analyzing the data from the past year, I was able to:

- Identify top-selling pizza categories and days of the week

- Optimize inventory and staffing levels
  
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns
  
- Improve overall sales and revenue

 # Conclusion & Recommendations
-Focus on Classic and Chicken pizzas — they drive most of the revenue.

-Promote sales during weekdays to balance the weekend-heavy pattern.

-Use seasonal promotions in slower months (Oct–Dec) to sustain volume.

-Continue offering Large pizzas, as they have the highest contribution margin.

-Review and possibly rework low-performing pizzas (e.g., Brie Carre, Spinach Supreme).
